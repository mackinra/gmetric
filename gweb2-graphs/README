To install just drop these files into your Ganglia graph.d directory.

NOTE: mem_report.php will be replaced (found a small bug in there).

To include the graphs in gweb2, add the graphs you want 
in /var/lib/ganglia/conf/default.json, like so:

{
  "included_reports": ["load_report","mem_report","cpu_report","network_report","apache_thr_report"]
}

This will add the graph to all hosts.  If you want to add host-specific exceptions,
add a file in /var/lib/ganglia/conf which is named host_HOSTNAME.json (where HOSTNAME 
is the short hostname known to ganglia) and looks something like this:

{
   "included_reports": ["mysql_command_report","mysql_select_report","mysql_handler_report","mysql_process_report","mysql_sort_report","mysql_disk_report","mysql_thr_report","mysql_qcache_report","mysql_qcache_block_report","mysql_qcache_mem_report","mysql_tmp_report","mysql_tmp_disk_report"],
   "excluded_reports": ["apache_thr_report"]
}
